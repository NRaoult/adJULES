This folder contains the current version of adJULES.

The main code can be found in the ADJULES_code folder. There should be not much need 
to change any of this fundamental code. 

!!!!
NB the file path giving the location of the adJULES/release folder need to be set in set_paths.R
!!!!

When conducting an experiment, adJULES is run in a temperatory directory (found in temp). This allows the possibility of running multiple experiments in parrallel. 

For at least the first 2 arguments
	-arg1 : temperatory folder name
	-arg2 : experiment PFT
	-arg3 : subset (all,single,ran5,boreal,rest,ever,deci) DEFAULT=all
	-arg4 : alpha  (either value, or search optimal via 'find' or 'brute') DEFAULT=find

Either - run in command line: ./create_temp.R arg1 agr2 etc.
       - change directory to temp/temp_arg1
       - run.R either in terminal or in R session
       - remove temperory directory once experiment is finished

Or     - run in command line: ./run.sh arg1 arg2 etc.
       - check progress in arg1_output.out

The results of experiment will be put into results directory.

If you wish to run experiments in the code directory, the first line in the R terminal should be: code <- getwd()
